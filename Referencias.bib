abstract = "Finite element formulations based on stabilized bilinear and linear equal-order-interpolation velocity-pressure elements are presented for computation of steady and unsteady incompressible flows. The stabilization procedure involves a slightly modified Galerkin/least-squares formulation of the steady-state equations. The pressure field is interpolated by continuous functions for both the quadrilateral and triangular elements used. These elements are employed in conjunction with the one-step and multi-step time integration of the Navier-Stokes equations. The three test cases chosen for the performance evaluation of these formulations are the standing vortex problem, the lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number 400, and flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number 100."

abstract = {Summary Simulation approaches for fluid-structure-contact interaction, especially if requested to be consistent even down to the real contact scenarios, belong to the most challenging and still unsolved problems in computational mechanics. The main challenges are 2-fold—one is to have a correct physical model for this scenario, and the other is to have a numerical method that is capable of working and being consistent down to a zero gap. Moreover, when analyzing such challenging setups of fluid-structure interaction, which include contact of submersed solid components, it gets obvious that the influence of surface roughness effects is essential for a physical consistent modeling of such configurations. To capture this system behavior, we present a continuum mechanical model that is able to include the effects of the surface microstructure in a fluid-structure-contact interaction framework. An averaged representation for the mixture of fluid and solid on the rough surfaces, which is of major interest for the macroscopic response of such a system, is introduced therein. The inherent coupling of the macroscopic fluid flow and the flow inside the rough surfaces, the stress exchange of all contacting solid bodies involved, and the interaction between fluid and solid are included in the construction of the model. Although the physical model is not restricted to finite element–based methods, a numerical approach with its core based on the cut finite element method, enabling topological changes of the fluid domain to solve the presented model numerically, is introduced. Such a cut finite element method–based approach is able to deal with the numerical challenges mentioned above. Different test cases give a perspective toward the potential capabilities of the presented physical model and numerical approach.},
